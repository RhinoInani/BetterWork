# BetterWork

## Goal and Purpose
Maintaining eye health and proper body posture while using laptops and computers is essential for overall well-being. Prolonged screen time can lead to digital eye strain, characterized by symptoms like dry eyes, blurred vision, and headaches. Similarly, poor posture can result in musculoskeletal issues such as back, neck, and shoulder pain. By practicing good ergonomics, taking regular breaks, and ensuring proper lighting, individuals can protect their eyes and maintain a healthy posture, thereby preventing discomfort and long-term health problems. Prioritizing these habits enhances productivity and promotes a healthier lifestyle.

This tool has the goal of being a downloadable application that watches users through their web cam and analyzes eye strain and body posture (mainly slouching).
